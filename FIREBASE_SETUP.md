# üî• Firebase Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Firebase remote storage for your calculus detection website annotations.

## Why Firebase?

Firebase provides:
- ‚úÖ **Reliable remote storage** - Never lose annotations even when Render restarts
- ‚úÖ **Easy external access** - View your backed up data from anywhere  
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates** - Annotations saved instantly to the cloud
- ‚úÖ **Simple 0/1 mapping** - Clear binary mapping of annotation data
- ‚úÖ **Web console access** - View and manage data through Firebase console

## Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Click "Create a project" 
3. Enter project name: `calculus-detection-backup`
4. Disable Google Analytics (not needed)
5. Click "Create project"

## Step 2: Set up Firestore Database

1. In your Firebase project, click "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in production mode" (we'll configure security later)
4. Select a location close to your region
5. Click "Done"

## Step 3: Generate Service Account

1. Go to Project Settings (gear icon) ‚Üí Service accounts
2. Click "Generate new private key"
3. Download the JSON file (keep it secure!)
4. The file looks like this:
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\n...\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n",
  "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk-...@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  ...
}
```

## Step 4: Configure Render Environment

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Environment"
4. Add new environment variable:
   - **Key**: `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS`
   - **Value**: Paste the entire JSON content from step 3 (as one line)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The JSON must be on a single line when pasted into the environment variable.

## Step 5: Deploy and Test

1. Your Render service will automatically redeploy with Firebase
2. Visit your admin panel: `https://your-app.onrender.com/view`
3. You should see "üî• Firebase Connected" 
4. Click "Test Firebase" to verify it's working
5. Visit the external viewer: `https://your-app.onrender.com/firebase-view`

## Step 6: View Your Data

### Option 1: Firebase Console
- Visit: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project-id/firestore`
- Browse collections: `annotations`, `users`, `images`

### Option 2: External Viewer
- Visit: `https://your-app.onrender.com/firebase-view`
- Real-time view of all annotations with stats

## Firebase Collections Structure

Your data will be organized in these collections:

### `annotations`
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-annotation-id",
  image_id: "image-filename",
  user_id: 123,
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  source: "test" | "annotate",
  original_image: "original-filename.jpg", 
  annotation_data: "{...json...}",
  mask_filename: "mask-filename.png",
  created_at: "firebase-timestamp",
  updated_at: "firebase-timestamp"
}
```

### `users` 
```javascript
{
  user_id: 123,
  first_annotation: "firebase-timestamp",
  last_annotation: "firebase-timestamp", 
  total_annotations: 5
}
```

### `images`
```javascript
{
  image_id: "filename.jpg",
  filename: "filename.jpg",
  source: "test" | "annotate",
  annotation_count: 3
}
```

## Security Notes

- Service account credentials give full access to your Firebase project
- Keep the JSON file secure and never commit it to version control
- Consider setting up Firestore security rules for production use
- The current setup allows read/write access for your application only

## Troubleshooting

### "Firebase not connected"
- Check that `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set
- Verify the JSON is valid and on a single line
- Check Render logs for Firebase initialization errors

### "Permission denied" errors
- Verify service account has Firestore permissions
- Check Firebase IAM roles for the service account

### Data not appearing
- Use "Test Firebase" button in admin panel
- Check Firebase console for data
- Verify Firestore rules allow writes

## Benefits Over Google Drive

‚úÖ **Instant access** - No complex folder setup or permissions  
‚úÖ **Real-time data** - See annotations immediately  
‚úÖ **Structured data** - Clean JSON format, not file-based  
‚úÖ **Built for apps** - Designed for web applications  
‚úÖ **Better reliability** - No file system dependencies  
‚úÖ **Easy queries** - Filter and search your data  

Your annotations will now be safely stored in Firebase and accessible from anywhere! üéâ

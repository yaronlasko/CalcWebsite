## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables (Set these in your hosting platform)
```
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
MAX_USER_ID=100
```

### 2. Files Already Configured
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment config
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway deployment config  
- ✅ `render.yaml` - Render deployment config
- ✅ `.env.production` - Production environment template
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with engines and scripts
- ✅ Updated `server.js` with production settings

### 3. Important Notes
- 🔔 **AI Features**: The AI model files (`segmentyolo.pt`, `best_model.pth`) are large and may not work on free hosting tiers
- 🔔 **File Uploads**: Uploaded images will be stored temporarily (may reset on free hosting)
- 🔔 **Database**: Currently uses CSV files - consider upgrading to a database for production

## 🎯 Recommended: Deploy to Railway (Best for this project)

Railway is perfect for your project because:
- ✅ Supports large files better than Vercel
- ✅ Persistent file storage
- ✅ Easy environment variable management
- ✅ Good for Node.js apps with Python integration

### Quick Railway Deploy Steps:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
6. Deploy!

## 🔒 Security for Production

1. **Change default admin password** in environment variables
2. **Use strong SESSION_SECRET** (generate random string)
3. **Enable HTTPS** (automatic on most hosting platforms)
4. **Review file upload limits** in your hosting dashboard

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Cannot find module" errors
- Make sure `package.json` dependencies are complete
- Run `npm install` locally to verify

### AI model not working
- Large model files may not deploy on free tiers
- Consider using a cloud storage service for model files

### File upload issues
- Check hosting platform's file size limits
- Ensure `/uploads` directory permissions are correct

## 📞 Need Help?
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the hosting platform's logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test locally first with `npm start`

**Your app is now ready to deploy! Choose your preferred platform above and follow the steps.**
